# Trees and Graphs

* A binary tree has each node made up of two children

```
                 9
               / | \
              5  7  11
             / \     \
            3   2    21
```

* A binary search tree is a binary tree in which every node fits into a specific
  ordering - `all left nodes < all right nodes`
* For a balanced tree, ensure O(log n) times for insert and find. Two common types of balanced trees are red-black and
  AVL trees
* Complete binary tree has every level of the tree fully filled, last level is filled left to right
